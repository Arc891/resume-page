HackrsChat is a personal-use self-host TUI chat application for you and your friends/community, written in Rust, making use of the Cursive library. 
This chat application will have a privacy-focused approach, with the ability to self-host the server and client, 
and with good encryption and safety practices, to be sure that your data is safe and secure.

## Features

So far we've implemented a few features:

- Self-hosted server and client
- Login/registration system locally
- Encrypted login session storing
- Separate chat rooms
- Support for `!` commands

## Motivation and Goals

The main motivation behind HackrsChat was to create a better version of my previous project HackersChat that I started in Python.
I had worked on this project by myself for a while, but after my Computer Security course in uni, I wanted to step up my game
and improve my skills in firstly security, but secondly the more dependable Rust language, and TUI development. I got working and asked
a good friend of mine with experience in Rust to help me out, and we got working on it together.

The project is currently still unfinished, as we both got busy with other commitments, but the intention to finish this project still remains.
