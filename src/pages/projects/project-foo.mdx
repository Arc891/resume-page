import CodeDemo from '../../components/CodeDemo.tsx'

This is an example case-study. It's written in MDX so you can mix Markdown and components.

**Problem:** show a small interactive demo on a mostly-static site without shipping React everywhere.

**Solution:** use an Astro React island to render a small code sandbox.

<CodeDemo reactDemo height="40rem" client:load />

**Outcome:** minimal JS sent to the client, content remains fully static and crawlable.
