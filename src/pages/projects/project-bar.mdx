# Project Bar

This is a second example case-study. It's written in MDX so you can mix Markdown and components.

**Problem:** show a small interactive demo on a mostly-static site without shipping React everywhere.

**Solution:** use an Astro React island to render a small code sandbox.

<CodeDemo initial={`<html><body><h2 style="font-family: Inter">Hello from the demo!</h2></body></html>`} client:load />

**Outcome:** minimal JS sent to the client, content remains fully static and crawlable.
