# Wordle Web
Link to the <a href={`${site.social.GitHub}/wordle-web`}>GitHub project</a>

A comprehensive Wordle implementation that goes beyond the basic game mechanics to include advanced features like puzzle solving algorithms, shareable game states, and multiple word sets.

## Features

- **Classic Wordle Gameplay**: Guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts with color-coded feedback
- **Multiple Word Sets**: Choose from common words (5.7k), previous Wordle words (1474), or all words (14.8k)
- **Shareable Links**: Generate unique URLs to share specific words with friends
- **Built-in Solver**: Advanced algorithm that suggests possible words based on current game state
- **Hint System**: Get strategic hints about most common letters in remaining possibilities
- **Game State Persistence**: Automatically saves progress and allows resuming games
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Solver Algorithm
The standout feature is the Wordle solver that uses constraint satisfaction:

- Analyzes letter positions and status (correct, present, absent)
- Filters word lists based on game constraints
- Provides statistical analysis of remaining possibilities
- Suggests optimal next guesses based on letter frequency

### Architecture
The project demonstrates clean JavaScript architecture:

- Modular design separating game logic, UI, and state management
- Efficient word filtering algorithms for real-time solving
- URL-based game sharing with encoded game states
- Local storage integration for game persistence

### Word Management
Comprehensive word list management with:
- 14,800+ word database with multiple difficulty levels
- Historical Wordle answer validation
- Efficient search and filtering capabilities
- Word encoding/decoding for shareable URLs

This project showcases both game development skills and algorithmic thinking, combining entertainment with technical depth.
