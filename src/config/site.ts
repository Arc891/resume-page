  about: `
    I'm a DevOps Engineer at Anamata where I work on infrastructure automation and Pega development. 
    At 2 meters tall, I have a good overview of both server racks and code architecture.

    I spend most of my time writing Python and Rust, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and making sure systems 
    don't break at 3 AM. I genuinely enjoy the challenge of building reliable infrastructure and creating 
    tools that make mine and other developers' lives easier.

    In my free time, I work on personal projects like HackrsChat (a Rust-based chat app) and contribute 
    to open source when I can. I'm also a big Formula 1 fan - there's something satisfying about both 
    well-tuned race cars and well-optimized code.
