# Resume Page

Opinionated starter for a multi-page resume built with Astro + TypeScript + Tailwind + MDX + React islands.

## Features
- Astro (static-first) with TypeScript
- MDX for project case studies with auto-discovery
- React islands for interactive components
- Tailwind CSS with custom theme system
- Contact form with Resend email integration
- Dark/light/Gruvbox themes to pick from
- Gravatar integration with fallback avatar
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Complete SEO & social media optimization (meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Cloudflare Workers deployment (`wrangler.toml` included)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For contact form development:

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Contact Form

The contact form is powered by Cloudflare Workers and Resend. To set it up:

1. Create a [Resend](https://resend.com) account and get an API key
2. Add environment variables to `.dev.vars`:
   ```
   TO_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   FROM_EMAIL=contact@your-domain.com
   FROM_NAME=Your Contact Form
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```
3. For production, use Wrangler secrets:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put TO_EMAIL
   npx wrangler secret put FROM_EMAIL
   npx wrangler secret put FROM_NAME
   npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

## MDX Projects

Project case studies are auto-discovered from `src/pages/projects/*.mdx`. Each MDX file becomes a route and supports:

### Frontmatter Configuration
```yaml
---
title: "Project Name"
description: "Project description for SEO"
date: 2025-01-01
tech: ["React", "TypeScript", "Tailwind"]
layout: "../../layouts/ProjectLayout.astro"
showcase: true  # Shows on homepage
preview: "https://demo-url.com"  # Optional demo link
---
```

### React Islands in MDX
Import and use React components directly:
```mdx
import CodeDemo from '../../components/CodeDemo.tsx'
import site from '../../config/site.ts'

<CodeDemo client:load />
```

### Auto-Generated Features
- Projects with `showcase: true` appear on the homepage
- `tech` array adds project-specific keywords for SEO
- Projects are sorted by date (newest first)
- ProjectLayout automatically handles metadata and styling

## Configuration

Edit `src/config/site.ts` to update your personal information, skills, and social links. This file controls:
- Name, role, and location in the header
- Skills badges on the homepage  
- Social links in footer
- Email address for contact form
- Employment status indicator with theme-aware colors
- SEO metadata (keywords, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)

### SEO & Social Media

The site includes comprehensive SEO optimization:
- Automatic meta tags (title, description, keywords)
- Open Graph tags for social media sharing
- Twitter Card support
- Canonical URLs
- Structured data ready

Update the `seo` section in `site.ts` for optimal results:
```typescript
seo: {
  baseUrl: 'https://yourdomain.com', // Your actual domain
  ogImage: '/og-image.svg',         // Social media sharing image
  twitterCreator: '@yourhandle',     // Optional Twitter handle
}
```

#### Using Metadata in Pages

For custom pages, pass metadata props to BaseLayout:
```astro
<BaseLayout 
  title="Custom Page Title"
  description="Custom description"
  keywords="custom, keywords"
  ogImage="/custom-image.png"
>
  <!-- Your content -->
</BaseLayout>
```

#### Enhanced MDX Projects

Project MDX files support enhanced frontmatter for better SEO:
```yaml
---
title: "Project Name"
description: "Detailed project description for SEO"
date: 2025-01-01
tech: ["React", "TypeScript"]  # Auto-added to keywords
showcase: true                 # Shows on homepage
ogImage: "/project-image.png"  # Custom social image
---
```

The `tech` array automatically enhances SEO keywords, and `description` is used for Open Graph tags.

### Employment Status

The site includes a dynamic employment status indicator that changes text and color based on your employment status, and also adapts to each theme:

```typescript
employment: {
  status: 'employed-open', // 'available' | 'employed-open'
  // ...
}
```

- **`'available'`**: Green across all themes - "Available for new opportunities"
- **`'employed-open'`**: Blue (light/dark) or Yellow (gruvbox) - "Currently employed • Open to connect"

## Deploy

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Notes

- Put a `resume.pdf` file in `public/` to make it available at `/resume.pdf`.
- There's an example `CodeDemo` React island under `src/components` used in `src/pages/projects/project-foo.mdx`.
- There's a `generate-pdf.js` script in `scripts/`, that uses Playwright to scrape your live server and generate PDFs from the relevant pages.
- The `.github/workflows/build.yml` will build the site, run the `generate-pdf.js` script, and upload both those generated resumes + the one you put in `/public/resume.pdf` and the `dist` folder as a workflow artifact.
